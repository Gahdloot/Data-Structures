'''A linked list is a system that links object together by
tracing location of the next object from the current object'''


'''linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in 
a linear order which are linked to each other. 
Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. 
Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.

Letâ€™s consider the following terms regarding linked lists.

    -Elements in a linked list are known as nodes.
    
    -Each node contains a key and a pointer to its successor node, known as next.
    
    -The attribute named head points to the first element of the linked list.
    
    -The last element of the linked list is known as the tail.'''
